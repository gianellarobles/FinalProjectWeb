    <h3 class="has-text-weight-medium has-text-centered">&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning of this year, I found out I had a health issue that led to changing my eating habits. I was not aware that I was lacking protein and consuming a high amount of carbohydrates. As a result, I had to meet with multiple doctors and go through different check-ups. They told me that I had a fatty liver, which was concerning to have in my early-twenties. As a result, I started seeing a nutritionist and she helped me come up with well-balanced meals. </h3>
    <br>
    <h3 class="has-text-weight-medium has-text-centered">&nbsp;&nbsp;Some changes I made was cutting out gluten and lowering my carb intake. Additionally, I started looking at ingredients and the nutrition fact label to all my foods. I noticed that certain foods had high sugar and high carbs so I tried to limit my amount. </h3>
